## What is Beandrip?

Beandrip allows you to "drip" "coffee" from "beans".

In other words, Beandrip allows you to inject HID Keystrokes
using a Raspberry Pi Pico (2) W and simple payload scripts
using the "Beanscript" library.

## Installation

The installation of Beandrip is quite simple.

1. Install Circuitpython for your Raspberry Pi Pico (2) W
([Install Links](https://circuitpython.org/downloads?q=raspberry+pi+pico))
2. Download and copy the `code.py` and `beanscript.py` files to the CIRCUITPY drive

And there you go!
